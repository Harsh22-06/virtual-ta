From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace.\nYou learn to write a log parser over weeks.

  "#/vercel": "Serverless hosting: Vercel\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They’re perfect for small web tools that\ndon’t need to run all the time\n. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nYou can’t\npip install\npackages - you have to use\nrequirements.txt\nYou can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can’t run commands (e.g.\nsubprocess.run()\n)\nVercel\nis a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions.

  "#/prompt-engineering": "Prompt Engineering\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\nAnthropic\nGoogle\nOpenAI\nHere are some best practices:\nUse prompt optimizers\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\nAnthropic Prompt Optimizer\nOpenAI Prompt Generation\nGoogle AI-powered prompt writing tools\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\nBAD\n:\nExplain gravitation lensing.\n(Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n(Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\nWhen you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\nThe clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\nFor example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\nSay, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nGive examples\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\nBAD\n:\nExplain how to tie a bow tie.\n(Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\nTo tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…\nTo tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…\nNow, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie.\n(Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\nGiving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nThink step by step\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\nBAD\n:\nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied?\n(Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\nGOOD\n:\nGiven this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step.\n(Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\nAsk the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\nThat’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\nInstead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\nFor example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nAssign a role\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\nBAD\n:\nExplain how to fix a software bug.\n(Reason: No role or perspective given.)\nGOOD\n:\nYou are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process.\n(Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\nTell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\nBy clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\nSuddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nUse XML to structure your prompt\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\nBAD\n:\nHere’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example.\n(Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\nGOOD\n:\n<\ninstructions\n>\nProvide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n</\ninstructions\n>\n<\nexample\n>\nThen provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n</\nexample\n>\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n(Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\nThink of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\nThey help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\nAnthropic\n|\nOpenAI\n|\nGoogle\nUse Markdown to format your output\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\nBAD\n:\nGive me the steps in plain text.\n(Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\nGOOD\n:\nProvide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points.\n(Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nBAD\n:\nCorrect the spelling and show the corrections.\n(Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\nGOOD\n:\nCorrect the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>.\n(Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nMarkdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\nYou can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\nThese make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\nUse JSON for machine-readable output\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\nBAD\n:\nJust list the items.\n(Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\nGOOD\n:\nOrganize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n```\njson\n[\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 1\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 1\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 2\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 2\"\n}\n,\n{\n\"name\"\n:\n\"Item 3\"\n,\n\"description\"\n:\n\"Description of Item 3\"\n}\n]\n```\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n(Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\nNote: Always use\nJSON schema\nif possible.\nJSON schema\nis a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\nImagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later.\nJSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\nEverything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\nFor example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\nThat way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\nPrefer Yes/No answers\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\nBAD\n:\nOn a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?\n(Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\nGOOD\n:\nIs this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No.\n(Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\nDon’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers.\nThey don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick.\nSo, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\nAsk for reason first, then the answer\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps\nbefore\nstating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\nBAD\n:\nWhat is the best route to take?\n(Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\nGOOD\n:\nFirst, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route.\n(Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\nBEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\nThat way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\nUse proper spelling and grammar\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\nBAD\n:\nxplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??\n(Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\nGOOD\n:\nExplain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation.\n(Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\nIf your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer.

  "#/embeddings": "Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\nSearch\n. Find similar documents to a query.\nClassification\n. Classify text into categories.\nClustering\n. Group similar items into clusters.\nAnomaly Detection\n. Find an unusual piece of text.\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost.

They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\nWhat Makes an Agent?\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\nLLM Brain\n: Makes decisions about what to do next\nTools\n: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\nMemory\n: Retains context across multiple steps\nAgents operate through a loop:\nObserve the environment\nThink about what to do\nTake action using tools\nObserve results\nRepeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\nWe’ve created a minimal command-line agent called\nllm-cmd-agent.py\nthat:\nTakes a task description from the command line\nGenerates code to accomplish the task\nAutomatically extracts and executes the code\nPasses the results back to the LLM\nProvides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\nHere’s how it works:\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py\n\"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py\n\"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nThe agent will:\nGenerate a shell script to list files with their sizes\nExecute the script in a subprocess\nCapture the output (stdout and stderr)\nPass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\nPresent a final answer to the user\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\nInitial prompt to generate a shell script\nCode extraction from the LLM response\nCode execution in a subprocess\nResult interpretation by the LLM\nError handling and retry logic if needed\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\nPlanning (generating code)\nExecution (running the code)\nReflection (interpreting results)\nAdaptation (fixing errors if needed)\nAgent Architectures\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\nReAct\n(Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\nReflexion\n: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\nMRKL\n(Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\nPlan-and-Execute\n: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\nReal-World Applications\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\nResearch assistants\nthat search, summarize, and synthesize information\nCoding assistants\nthat write, debug, and explain code\nData analysis agents\nthat clean, visualize, and interpret data\nCustomer service agents\nthat handle queries and perform actions\nPersonal assistants\nthat manage schedules, emails, and tasks\nProject Ideas\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\nStudy buddy agent\n: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\nJob application assistant\n: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\nPersonal finance agent\n: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\nHealth and fitness coach\n: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\nCourse project helper\n: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\nBest Practices\nClear instructions\n: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations\nEffective tool design\n: Create tools that are specific and reliable\nRobust error handling\n: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\nMemory management\n: Balance context retention with token efficiency\nUser feedback\n: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\nLimitations and Challenges\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\nHallucination\n: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\nPlanning limitations\n: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\nTool integration complexity\n: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\nContext window constraints\n: Limited memory for long-running tasks\nSecurity concerns\n: Tool access requires careful permission management\nPrevious\nFunction Calling\nNext\nLLM Image Generation",

Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data.\nThe second way is you can\nquery it\nfrom somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\nThe third way is you have to\nscrape it\n. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file.

Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you’re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nBut it's probably worth it.\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nCourse experience and farewell post\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\nYou need a\ngood\nunderstanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\nBut isn’t this a data science course?\nYes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are,\nsome\nof the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you\ndo\nneed programming to learn many of them.\nIf you passed, don't enroll again\nThe course is public, so you can always audit it.\nAlso, registering again for the course\ndoes not improve marks much\n.\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you’ve learnt.\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the\ncommit history\nfor changes.\nDevelopment Tools\nand concepts to\nbuild\nmodels and apps.\nDeployment Tools\nand concepts to\npublish\nwhat you built.\nLarge Language Models\nthat make your work easier and your apps smarter.\nData Sourcing\nto get data from the web, files, and databases.\nData Preparation\nto clean up and convert the inputs to the right format.\nData Analysis\nto find surprising insights in the data.\nData Visualization\nto communicate those insights as visual stories.\nAnyone can audit this course\nEveryone has access to:\nCourse content at\nhttps://tds.s-anand.net/\nEvaluations\nYou can solve these questions any time and check your answers before the submission dates.\nOnly\nenrolled students\ncan participate in\nDiscourse\n, get project evaluations, take the final end-term, or get a certificate.\nThose auditing can join the\nTDS 2025 May Google Group\nfor announcements.\nEvaluations are mostly open Internet\nTentative dates:\nExam\nType\nWeight\nRelease Date\nSubmission Date\nGA: Graded assignments\nBest 4 out of 7\n15%\nGraded Assignment 1\nDiscuss\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nThu 01 May 2025\nSun 18 May 2025\nGraded Assignment 2\nDiscuss\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nThu 05 May 2025\nSun 25 May 2025\nGraded Assignment 3\nDiscuss\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nFri 20 May 2025\nSun 01 Jun 2025\nP1: Project 1\nOnline open-Internet\n20%\nFri 16 May 2025\nSat 14 Jun 2025\nGraded Assignment 4\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nWed 11 Jun 2025\nSun 22 Jun 2025\nGraded Assignment 5\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nWed 18 Jun 2025\nSun 29 Jun 2025\nGraded Assignment 6\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nWed 02 Jul 2025\nSun 13 Jul 2025\nROE: Remote Online Exam\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\n20%\nSun 20 Jul 2025 13:00\nSun 20 Jul 2025 13:45\nGraded Assignment 7\nOnline open-Internet MCQ\nWed 16 Jul 2025\nSun 27 Jul 2025\nP2: Project 2\nOnline open-Internet\n20%\nFri 11 Jul 2025\nFri 8 Aug 2025\nF: Final end-term\nIn-person, no internet\n25%\nSun 31 Aug 2025\nSun 31 Aug 2025\nUpdates:\n5 May 2025:\nGA1 submission date postponed from 11 May to 18 May 2025\nGA2 submission date postponed from 18 May to 25 May 2025\nGA3 submission date\npreponed\nfrom 01 Jun to 25 May 2025 since there’s a break the week after\nNotes\nGraded Assignment 1\nchecks course pre-requisites\n.

    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Greetings sir! Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit\nYes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses. However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different. Is this information available to everyone @carlton sir?\nHello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment. We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well. Looking forward to your kind consideration. Best regards, Digvijaysinh Chudasama\nThe Same happened to me. They should have informed this before.\nHello @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand sir, I hope you are doing well. As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7. Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade.

Best regards, HARSH JAYSWAL\n@s.anand @carlton same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter.\n@carlton @s.anand There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton , we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.\n@carlton sir , This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain  GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ? Kindly consider\nsame for me also … Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nExactly! This should have been informed beforehand. It’s really unfair\nIt the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.\n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this. Regards: Akash\n@carlton I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.\nGood evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.

Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you\nExactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not\n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.\n@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request. Thank you\n@carlton sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this Thanking you waiting for your answer",

Sir plzzz it is my request.\nJust as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective). So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.\nThis is not up to us.

Please correct me if I am wrong.\nAny updates on these? I am too facing the same issue. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nIn GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything. Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one image 2083×575 47.6 KB\nKindly update us regarding the status of Q1 & Q2 @carlton @Jivraj\n@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Dear TDS Team, There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention: Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance. The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support.\nYes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous. For instance: forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data. but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?\nLet’s wait for their response. I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4\n@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Can you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem). Thanks\nHi @all Question intends you to select most correlated one. Select option which is absolute highest.\n@Jivraj - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer. The answer is coming to around 11.5 kms which is 11500 meters. Q.A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Pine Pines Junction : (26.5596,-99.5336) ;Maple Fields Station : (26.4212,-99.4597);South Glen Crossing : (26.5962,-99.5243);Cedar Creek Retreat : (26.56,-99.4519) & Central Command Post Location: (26.4644,-99.4771) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance\nimage 1318×377 34.2 KB what to do if 3 options have same value -0.04 and all are correct?\n@carlton @Jivraj My question 7 for GA6 is : A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance Whose options provided are : 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters) I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters) Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)",

I request you to share module weightage (if it’s not secret). Please release mock as early as possible because this term course content has been changed so pyqs won’t help much. Thanks Sujay D\n@carlton , please release the mock or give us the proper resources. The resources in the course introduction and the pyqs have no similarities. Many questions come from other topics, such as MLT and many others. Those who didn’t complete it find it too difficult. Please don’t keep us in delusion.\nGoing through GA’s would be good idea.\nYes sir please it will help us to prepare better for end term.\nYes sir we all are facing the same problem.\nThe Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock. End term is usually very easy for TDS. A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are. Kind regards\n@Carlton With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns? Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?\nI recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session.\nPractice PYQ Drive link provied in Tuesdays End term revision Session docs.google.com PYQ Sheet This Sheet is private\nSir could you provide the recording for yesterday’s live session as in youtube its not uploaded yet Thank you\nSir will the recent 3 pyqs be sufficient as the pyqs before 2024 are different compared to the recent ones.

Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM 1776×228 15.5 KB\n@24ds2000125 @22f3000585 I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards\nSir, Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query. I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself). I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th. I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it. Thankyou!\nOne thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.\nWell noted sir. Thanks a lot!\nSir, I received the mail today - image 652×156 5.43 KB Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself. image 836×101 18.2 KB Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided. image 1113×487 20.2 KB Sir can you please check.

Make sure: Your code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times) Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations Your AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month. For those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.\n\nsir show us all the way to do project\nHi Shouvik, We will have live sessions to guide on how to do project. Kind regards Jivraj\nWill those session be on youtube too?\nHi Sakthivel, Yes all sessions are being recorded and are available on youtube within a day.

Can you mention what is need of making changes ? command that I used : uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

Token not being correct.\nyes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you .\nWhile implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement.

Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux? @Jivraj @carlton\nThe bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with. For more information watch this video https://youtu.be/q74CP4fB7cY?si=M_zw8WzpmMCyVQat or watch TDS Live Sessions. Regards, TDS TA\nwhat frameworks can we use? hopefully anything? or what frameworks can’t we use? @carlton @Jivraj\nProject 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am 1764×1764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards\n@23f1002382 You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20+) API tasks. Kind regards\nA sample evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1-A10 is available at tools-in-data-science-public/project-1 at tds-2025-01-project-1-wip · sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public · GitHub You can use this to validate your code for Project 1.

This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th). If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.\nHi @23f2005702 @lakshaygarg654 Firstly, congratulations on your success. And surely you can demonstrate your project. It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.\nThank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my Azure API URL would be exposed , and since it incurs costs per usage , I need to keep it secure. I’d prefer a private meet to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!\nThat’s amazing @23f2005702 , so far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal).\n@Saransh_Saini I can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards\nCongrats for your project mate! Just wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments?

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay\ntigertds 212×148 6.99 KB @carlton It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.\nlakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards\nWe do not know yet. Please read reply to the original poster. Thanks, Kind regards\nThank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response. Regards, Lakshay",

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards.\n@Jivraj @carlton “SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these.  Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?",

    "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476",
    "content": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\nYes sir please look into this\n@Anand @Bharathi Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern.\nYes sir, even it is tough for tech background students, just think about that how non-tech background students are handling the pressure for this course. Please consider this request. @carlton , @Saransh_Saini , @Jivraj , @Anand\nYes @s.anand sir @jkmadathil sir @Bharathi Mam, Plss look into this as this is becoming too too hectic ans stressful now Mam.\nRight, I put 3 to 4 days on a GA. I still am not able to fully grasp the concept. I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock. I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.\nHi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.\nPlease look into it sir.\nThank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed .  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.\nRegarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course. I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.\nNicely highlighted the concern of all students. TDS as a course has been really tedious this term. It’s a headache for those with non-technical background. IITM Management please look into this matter on urgent basis.\nDam… Even when I have finished the course (with a B ) I’m still getting dragged into this …\nBut still this is a huge Problem … jkmadathil: LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #\nGreat! a nice post sir, I accept it is hard and I am harder than this too.\nTruly agree with your point. It is hard. If the marking scheme is unpredictable, why not remove the whole grading system from this course. This is punishment even when you do learn. Hopefully, I would like a better grading system in future, even the course is designed very well!\nSeeing the difficulty of TDS I feel like appying to Anand Sir’s company lol. I am barely surviving but enjoying every moment of it. But seriously though remembering everything is super difficult.\nYou will survive. Just watch tonight’s session. and prepare and practise.",

    "content": "Hello Sir, I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM. Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared. Thanks and Regards Shalini\nTag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…\nIt is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards\nhi @carlton how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\nYou will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form. I will also add the same in the student seek portal. Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either! The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

They will be available after the live session has finished. 23f1002382: will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions? We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1 23f1002382: will the live solving video lecture be recorded? Yes our live sessions will be recorded.\nthanks for the prompt response! Cheers . Also to my understanding at sharp 7:00 we get email with form link and questions dataset?\nHi @carlton , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.\ncarlton: No, we do not provide solutions as a notebook. The ROE will be solved during the live session. yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks, also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta\nHi @shubhamatkal , For question1 provided answer is wrong. Regarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions. For Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately For Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers. Kind regards.",

    "content": "@carlton @jkmadathil Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also. Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.\nAlso, it seems impossible to complete it in 45 minutes.\nyou got the wrong Anand here.  You perhaps wanted to tag the faculty of this course s.anand (I’m purposely not tagging him; you may do so)\nI feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side you are famous (or infamous depending on perspective ) Kind regards\nJust FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is @s.anand Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances. Kind regards\nSir I understand but it will badly affects our CGPA.\nSir can you at least increase the time limit from 45 minutes to 1 hour?\nThe time limit for ROE will be set according to the difficulty level of the ROE. Kind regards",

Thanks! @carlton @s.anand code to take reference from: import gzip\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nlog_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'\nstart_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nend_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nlog_data = []\n\ndef parse_log(line):\n    parts = line.split(' ')\n    log_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')\n    method, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])\n    return log_time, method, url, status\n\nwith gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:\n    for entry in file:\n        log_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)\n        if method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:\n            if log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:\n                log_data.append(entry)\n\nprint(f\"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}\") ps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!\nI’m also facing same kind of issue in Q3, GA5, while cross checked answer from different methods getting same result 1603, which is showing incorrect. Kindly check this issue. Thanks\nThe same issue is being faced by many students, not only for this condition, but others as well. Please look into it\nactually i got 130 as answer. but the answer accepted by the portal was 129. i felt like, i have to change one or two numbers front and back, i tried the same before. it worked\nFor the same question? But it shouldnt be +1 -1 to get the correct answer right.\nHi @muskan2431 we are running some checks. Please bear with us, Kind regards\nWe have determined that some students were affected by GA5 Q3. Whoever we have identified as having received the incorrect assessment will receive 1 mark for that particular question.

How this is beneficial? As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

    "content": "Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these. Syllabus kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time Any mock or resource to practice from? additional tips, if any\nModules 1 - 5 Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame. We will have some past ROEs as practise … watch sessions Kind regards\nThanks for the answer @carlton Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\nSir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\nROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc. Kind regards\nThe ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards\nIs there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?\nDepends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?\n@JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\ni downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg  and used this Convert your MP3 to Text for Free Online , it worked",

    "content": "Hello @carlton and @Jivraj and @s.anand sir It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project. Thanks Vikram\n@carlton @s.anand Yes Sir please extend the project deadline.\nyes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in previous terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend the deadline or give out some resources.\nYes @s.anand , @carlton , The project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work. Additionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our doubts.\n@carlton @s.anand yes sir please extend the project deadline.\nSir please extend the deadline it’s really hard to do we need more time\nYes, it’s too hectic to balance work and this project\n@carlton @s.anand sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.\n@carlton @s.anand sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday\nPlease extend the deadline\n@s.anand @carlton sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very difficult,  we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended…\nPlease at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.\nKindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. @carlton @s.anand\nIndeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them. EXTEND !!!\nKindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as many students have their GATE exam on Saturday. A slight extension would be greatly helpful.\nSIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us  2 to 3 days it was helpful for us.\n@22f1000376 @22f3000276 @23f2004636 @23f2004563 @sharik4real @Mystic_9803 @Rishabh2 @23f1002279 @varun_parashar @22f2001175 and others… I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team\n-Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used. @carlton @s.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project. Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B. Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.\n@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here - Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here. Thank you.\nsir…please extend the deadline…",

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards",

You won’t be able to submit the assignments, so you might have to self-evaluate.\n@22f2000559 – Good point. I’ve enabled access now. @parthpatel – nice workaround!\n@carlton @s.anand Sorry to bother you again, but there is another issue about inactive download buttons for required files for the problems.

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\nHi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards",

    "title": "Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python",
    "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922",
    "content": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\nYes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards\nFor some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions. Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you\nThank you sir for clarifying. carlton: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.",

    "content": "I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal . Same goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.",
